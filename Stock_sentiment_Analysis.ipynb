    "### Inspiration for the project:\n",
    "Stock Market is a huge gamble for some because they are not informed with proper data to make the right decisions. People take a lot of time in deciding which Cafe they would walk into but not spend enough time on the stock they invest. It is because people have less time but this is when AI comes to the rescue. Abstractive summarization and webscrapping seems to aid us more to gather the required information to make the right decisions.\n",

    "National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia’s largest lender by assets, agreed to buy rival Samba Financial Group for 15 dollars billion in the biggest banking takeover this year.NCB will pay 28.45 riyals (dollars7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5 percentage premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24 percentage higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than 220 billion, creating the Gulf region third-largest lender. The entity’s 46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about 268 billion of assets. </br>\n",

       "  'Through this integration financial institutions can personalize their banking experience, adopt digital innovations, and uncover new revenue streams by embracing the cloud MIAMI, June 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Technisys, the company behind Cyberbank, the cloud-native, next-gen digital banking platform, has integrated its platform with Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services to offer financial institutions (FIs) the ability to differentiate and redefine the customer experience within a cloud-native, end-to-end financial services technologies, accelerating a bank\\'s digital transformation. This integration allows scalability for even the largest banks with up to 150 million customers. Many banks today are managing legacy systems siloed across internal departments. This limits the institutions\\' ability to deliver a seamless customer experience consistently across channels - prohibiting FIs from being customer-centric, agile, future-proof, and scalable. This integration provides a strong and well-defined path to build a complete banking ecosystem for FI\\'s. It creates a platform for a more cohesive digital transformation process that will enable banks to deliver exceptional customer experiences, lower operational costs, and a digital edge. \"Our integration with Microsoft strengthens our commitment to redefining the banking experience for consumers and business owners,\" says Mike Santos, CEO of Technisys. \"We are empowering banks to create and deliver novel and tailored financial products, designed to be integral to customer lifestyles. Now, combined with\\xa0 Microsoft Azure\\'s cloud computing platform, we will enable FIs to embrace a digital transformation more quickly and cost effectively - without disrupting day-to-day business. It\\'s a compelling and proven value proposition.\" \"Technisys\\' integration with Microsoft Cloud for Financial Services enables financial institutions to accelerate their digital journey and transition to a cloud model,\" said Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President of Worldwide Financial Services at Microsoft. \"We know that pursuing a digital transformation is challenging, but with the powerful capabilities of both Technisys and Microsoft we can empower our customers to innovate faster and focus more on delivering value to their customers, versus maintaining their legacy systems.\" The integration introduces capabilities that come from the unveiling of a new and robust partner ecosystem with a proven, next-gen digital banking platform - where FI\\'s can differentiate, deliver personalization,',\n",
       "  'Tech companies continue to hit the breaks on hiring against the backdrop of a declining stock market and recession fears. On June 30th, Meta\\'s (META) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the social media giant would scale back hiring and warned of an economic downturn. \"If I had to bet, I\\'d say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we\\'ve seen in recent history,\" Zuckerberg told employees during a weekly Q&A session which was recorded and heard by Reuters.  Earlier in June, Tesla\\'s CEO Elon Musk ordered a hiring pause worldwide, citing a “super bad feeling” about the economy.  JPMorgan\\'s CEO Jamie Dimon also warned of an economic “hurricane\" ahead as the Federal Reserve continues its process of normalizing interest rates. Hiring pauses, rescinded offers, and layoffs accelerated last quarter as stocks in every sector of the S&P 500 declined. Communications Services and Technology were among the worst performing sectors, behind Consumer Discretionary. The S&P 500 closed out its biggest loss for the first half of the year since 1970. Yahoo Finance is tracking how tech companies are responding to a bear stock market, and a slowing economy. Meta (META) Facebook\\'s parent company plans to slash hiring plans for engineers by at least 30%, according to Reuters. In late June, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees the company aims to hire between 6,000-7,000 engineers in 2022, down from an initial target closer to 10,000. Meta had confirmed it would limit its intake of new employees in May, but exact figures had not been reported. The social media giant had 77,805 employees worldwide as of March 31, 2022.

       "  'Speculation is mounting that late Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen\\'s pro sports teams could be sold. Nike founder Phil Knight already submitted a $2 billion bid for the Portland Trail Blazers. Allen\\'s trust has sold off other assets, including property and a yacht, since his death in 2018. When Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen died in 2018, he left behind a collection of assets ranging from multimillion-dollar properties to a 414-foot megayacht. While much of it has been sold in the years since, two expensive — and high-profile — holdings remain: the NBA\\' Portland Trail Blazers and the NFL\\' Seattle Seahawks. The fates of Allen\\'s pro sports teams have been unclear since his death, when his trust passed into the hands of his sister, Jody Allen. Jody Allen hasn\\'t given a single interview in the intervening years, which means there are few clues about the future of the two teams. But speculation is mounting that both teams could be sold off to fulfill the terms of Paul Allen\\'s estate, and sold off in the near future. With both teams valued at or above $2 billion, there\\'s a small pool of moguls wealthy enough to submit a bid — and one famous exec has already made an offer. Here\\'s what we know about Allen\\'s estate, and the future of his teams. Allen made his fortune building Microsoft with Bill Gates Paul Allen and his Microsoft cofounder, Bill Gates, met in high school and founded the company in 1975 — it was Allen who coined the name \"Microsoft.\" Allen left the company in the early 1980s after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In the decades that followed, he spent his time as a philanthropist, donating millions, and pursuing his hobbies, like exploring shipwrecks, music, collecting art and mansions, and, eventually, purchasing the Blazers and the Seahawks. At the time of Allen\\'s death, Forbes placed his net worth at $20 billion. He bought the Portland Trail Blazers in 1988 Allen paid $70 million for the Blazers back in the late 1980s and promised to keep the team in Portland — today, the Blazers are valued'],\n",

While Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been pursuing the acquisition of social media platform Twitter Inc, his crown jewel, Tesla, has grappled with production glitches in China and slow output growth at new factories in Texas and Berlin. Analysts expect Tesla to report deliveries of 295,078 vehicles for the second quarter as early as Friday, according to Refinitiv data. Several analysts have slashed their estimates further to about 260,000 due to China\\'s prolonged lockdown. This would be down from its record deliveries of 310,048 the preceding quarter, marking Tesla\\'s first quarter-on-quarter decline in deliveries since the first quarter of 2020. The world\\'s most valuable automaker has posted record deliveries every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, weathering pandemic and supply-chain disruptions better than most automakers. China has been instrumental in Tesla\\'s rapid increase of vehicle production and Musk has praised workers there for \"burning the 3 a.m. oil.\" But China\\'s prolonged zero-COVID lockdown - Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called it Tesla\\'s \"albatross\" this quarter - caused deeper disruptions to output than Musk predicted. Tesla\\'s low-cost, lucrative Shanghai factory produced roughly half of the company\\'s total cars delivered last year, and Ives estimated the shutdown wiped out about 70,000 units in the quarter. Musk said in April that Tesla\\'s overall vehicle production in the second quarter would be \"roughly on par\" with the first quarter, driven by a China rebound. But he recently said Tesla had a \"very tough quarter,\" citing production and supply-chain challenges in China. Musk also said Tesla\\'s new factories in Texas and Berlin are \"gigantic money furnaces\" losing billions of dollars as they struggle to increase production quickly. He said the carmaker\\'s supply-chain problems are not over and keeping the factories running remains a concern. \"The key question is the magnitude of the (China production) decline and whether the Fremont',\n",

       " 'BTC': [\"Watch: The Crypto Mile - The Power and Potential of Cryptocurrencies Crypto is often heralded as the best innovation since world wide web and its disruptive power as the force that is going to redefine the world's financial networks. Its backers vouch by its liberating and reforming potential to switch transactions to decentralised finance, thus getting rid of intermediaries, including and most importantly banks. Critics, however, point out that the blockchain technology that crypto is based on has some merits but claims of crypto tokens replacing money is pure baloney. That, however, hasn't deterred punters taking huge bets. Some made big gains, several lost fortunes – and lifelong savings. In recent months the crypto crash has only become deeper, with several false alarms of 'hitting the bottom'. The crypto market cap has shrunk from $3.2tn (£2.6tn) in November 2021 to barely $1tn. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) tanked to below $20,000 earlier in June, while ether, the token linked to the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain, fell to nearly $1,000. The crypto churn is still on, and many claim that those still standing at the end will be the Amazons of the post-dotcom crash. Amid this backdrop comes Yahoo Finance's new show 'The Crypto Mile' where we will be interviewing some of the leading figures in the industry, both backers and critics, to try and make sense of everything: from buying plots in the metaverse to owning NFTs. Episode 1, published today, features a diverse range of opinions from Johns Hopkins University Applied Economics professor Steve Hanke, bitcoin educator and entrepreneur Jimmy Song, and 'the real Wolf of Wall Street' Jordon Belfort.

       "  'Don\\'t miss CoinDesk\\'s Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12. Bitcoin slid almost 38% in June to record its second-biggest monthly loss since its debut in 2009. It traded over $31,000 on June 1 and dropped to as low as $17,700 mid-month, before recovering and ending the month at $19,209, according to CoinGecko data. The monthly decline is second only to bitcoin\\'s plunge of 38.6% in August 2011, and pushed prices below 2017\\'s highs. June\\'s losses came amid declining macroeconomic sentiment, fears of inflation and systemic risks from within the crypto ecosystem, such as the possible insolvency of crypto lender Celsius Network and the blowup of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. “The losses were caused by many factors,\" said Ali Kassab, chairman of crypto investment firm Centurion & Co. “These included monetary policies bordering on central banks\\' response to rising inflation fueled by COVID-19 and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. \"From Terra’s collapse to the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital and unending layoffs, the bad trend in the crypto industry weighed down the price of bitcoin,” Kassab added, noting he expected institutional investments “to pour into the asset” and create \"better price performance\" in July. Others such as Chris Terry of lending platform SmartFi say they expect bitcoin to trade in a fairly narrow range in the short term. “The feeling of the trading desk is that if bitcoin stays in the $18,000 to $20,000 [range], it\\'s going to be a long drawn out, and we could be in this trading range now for weeks,” he said. “Everybody kind of feels that bitcoin needs to wash out and take out all the short positions and reset, which would be probably the full 80% retracement, which is typical in the markets, which would be down in the $12,000 to $13,000 range,” Terry added.

The world's largest bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund lost half of its assets under management last Friday, which might have exacerbated bitcoin’s crash on Saturday. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw an outflow of 24,510 bitcoins on Friday, the most severe redemption in a single day since the fund made its debut on the Canadian Stock Exchange in April 2021, according to the Norway-based Arcane Research. The outflows mean that the fund had to sell about $500 million in BTC at Friday’s price, adding to the selling pressure in an already shaky crypto market, Arcane wrote in a report. “The enormous outflows are likely caused by a forced seller in a huge liquidation,” Arcane analyst Vetle Lunde wrote. “The forced selling of the 24,000 BTC could have triggered BTC’s move down towards $17,600 this weekend.” Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $20,000 on Saturday, tumbling to as low as $17,678. Traders were rattled by fears of crypto industry insolvencies, as crypto lender Celsius Network halted client withdrawals, BlockFi sought additional financing and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital confirmed it suffered heavy losses. The weekend's price action also marked the first time that the largest cryptocurrency had fallen below its previous cycle’s all-time high, notched in December 2017, of $19,783. Bitcoin ETFs track the value of bitcoin and provide a way to invest in the largest cryptocurrency without dealing directly with crypto; they can be bought, sold and traded on traditional stock market exchanges instead of on cryptocurrency trading platforms. ETFs actively add and sell bitcoin to match investors investing in and redeeming from the fund. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF was by far the largest bitcoin-focused exchange-traded product, managing almost 48,000 bitcoins before Friday’s redemptions. Now, the fund holds only about 23,300 BTC.

Firms including Coinbase (COIN) have announced layoffs, while some firms have been forced to liquidate positions or freeze customer accounts. Following the crypto lender Celsius Network’s move to freeze all customer accounts, Babel Finance has also cooled trading, citing “unusual liquidity pressures” according to a customer note.
